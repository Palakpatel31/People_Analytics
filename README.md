# People Analytics on Employees Performance

In this People Analytics project, the focus was on understanding the factors that influence employee performance. 
The project involved analyzing various factors, including gender, age, and other relevant variables, to determine 
their impact on employee performance.

To achieve this, statistical techniques such as chi-square analysis, factor analysis, one-way ANOVA, and regression 
analysis were employed. Chi-square analysis was used to examine the association between categorical variables like 
gender and performance levels. Factor analysis helped identify underlying factors that contribute to employee 
performance. One-way ANOVA was performed to compare performance across different age groups or other relevant 
categories. Regression analysis was utilized to establish relationships and quantify the impact of multiple factors 
on employee performance.

Through the application of these statistical techniques and hypothesis testing, valuable insights were gained 
regarding the significant factors influencing employee performance. The project provided a comprehensive understanding 
of how variables such as gender, age, and other factors impact employees' overall performance, enabling organizations 
to make informed decisions and implement strategies to enhance employee productivity and engagement.
